  "Calculates the fuzzy score of matching STRING with ABBREVIATION.

The score is a float number calculated based on the number characters
from `abbreviation' that match `string' and how immediate they are to each
other.

For example, for an `abbreviation' of 'instpkg', the score of

   'package-install' is 6.5819

and for

   'install-package' is 7.9400

meaning that the second one will appear first on text completion.

The numbers left to the decimal point are the count of how many
characters did match on a forward search, eg, in the first example,
'instpkg' matches 'inst' from chars 8 then has to backtrack for p but
'kg' are forward-found again, so the number of forward-matched chars is 6.
This means that abbreviations having not to backtrack are high scored
as it is a better extact match.

The numbers right to the decimal point are the ratio of how many
chars did matches in the string from the start position."
